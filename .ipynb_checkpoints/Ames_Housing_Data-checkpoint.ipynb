    "> The Ames Housing dataset, which describes the sale of individual residential property in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010, was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It was designed based after the Boston Housing dataset and is now considered a more modernized and expanded version of it. More details of this dataset are described in [Ames, Iowa: Alternative to the Boston Housing Data as an End of Semester Regression Project](https://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock.pdf).\n",
